        <p>We're a group of 150 volunteers who have been working evenings and weekends since early autumn 2015 to make Just Arrived a reality. We represent numerous competences, backgrounds and organizations, but everyone shares the collective goal of
          making it easier for New Arrivals to get a job and the chance to get into Swedish society. We're always on the lookout for passionate and talented people, irrespective of whether they represent an organisation or just themselves. For current
          needs, see the Join Us section below.</p>
